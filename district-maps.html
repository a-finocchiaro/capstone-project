                <p>
                    The District area includes three counties in Arizona including: La Paz, Mohave, and Yuma.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ten cities and towns are members including: Bullhead City, Colorado City, Kingman, Lake Havasu City, Parker, Quartzsite, San Luis, Somerton, Wellton, and Yuma.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Six reservations are wholly or partly in the District: Cocopah Indian Tribes, Colorado River Indian Tribes &#40;CRIT&#41;, Fort Mojave Indian Tribe, Hualapai Indian Tribe, Kaibab Band of Paiute Indians, and Fort Yuma Quechan Tribe. The Colorado River
                    Indian Tribes include four distinct Tribes - the Mohave, Chemehuevi, Hopi and Navajo.</p>
                <p>
                    The District stretches from Mexico on the South to Nevada and Utah on the North and is bounded by California and Nevada on the West.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The District covers 23,519 square miles.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most of the western border is demarcated by the Colorado River. Most communities are on or near the Colorado River.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All three Counties and all ten Cities and Towns have chosen to formally participate in and support the District.

                <h3 id="c24">2.4 Geography</h3>
                <p>
                    The geography and climate of the District range from low elevations, flat plains, small mountains, and arid environments in Southwestern Yuma County to higher mountains receiving moderate amounts of rain in northeastern Mohave County. Elevations range
                    from barely above sea level to more than 5,000 feet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most of the area along the Colorado River, as most of the District, is arid and adequately classified as desert. Rainfall varies from little more than two inches per year in Yuma to about 16 inches per year in parts of Mohave County. The climate is sweltering
                    throughout most of the District, with Yuma and Lake Havasu having recorded high temperatures of 127 and 128 respectively. Temperatures moderate some in northeastern Mohave County, with light winter snows in Kingman and a somewhat colder
                    climate in the Colorado City area, which is at a higher elevation.

                <p>
                    Primary natural resources include climate, isolation, some mineral deposits, and the Colorado River. Primary man-made resources include a series of dams on the Colorado River, their related irrigation systems, and the East/West transportation corridors
                    &#40;i.e., Interstate 8 and Interstate 10&#41;. Mineral deposits in the region include gold, silver, copper, feldspar, and molybdenum, all of which have been found in Mohave County.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some gold deposits are also located in La Paz County. Mining and mineral processing are not currently major economic activities within the region but were prominent in the past in Mohave County. For mining and mineral processing to become essential contributors
                    to the local economies would probably require the discovery of significant new mineral deposits.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dams and diversions on the Colorado River within the District include Hoover, Davis, Parker, Palo Verde, Laguna, and Imperial. Barriers create potentials for power generation, irrigation, and recreation and all are essential resources for the District’s
                    communities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The combination of Colorado River reservoirs, warm and dry climate, and convenient east/west highways have developed a strong tourist industry directed towards water-related recreation in the District. Communities, where this industry is particularly
                    important, include Parker, Lake Havasu, and Bullhead City.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Where water-related relaxation is a central portion of the tourist trade, it creates opportunities for year-round tourism, some recreation-oriented tourism, ‘snowbirds’, and RVers in the winter, significant water-related recreation in the summer. Tourists
                    focused on water sports also tend to be more affluent than the snowbird/RV group and create options for a more lucrative upscale tourist industry.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The river and dams also enable the District’s agriculture. The arid climate makes farming impossible without irrigation. Of the District’s more than 325,000 acres of cropland, more than 93% is irrigated.

                    The dams and related irrigation systems are what make the agricultural industries in Yuma and La Paz Counties viable. A unique advantage of the District of farming activities is it's <em>reversed</em> growing season. The primary growing
                    season is winter when the climate moderates to temperatures that in other areas are typical of summer. Yuma County thus produces much of the country’s winter vegetables, especially iceberg lettuce.

                <p>
                    Environmental concerns can be viewed as falling into two categories, Colorado River and Other. The map embedded below shows the location and type of environmental hazards identified by the EPA in the District and State of Arizona. Environmental concerns
                    cluster around the larger communities and are typical of urban issues such as air quality and the finding of ground pollution from past uses when environmental regulations were less strict. The level of the problems is moderate, and
                    no significant concerns that would restrict development are currently at issue.
                </p>
                <iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/1/embed?mid=1cuCMu56NkrVfVr_tKW5clWTqs40" width="640" height="480"></iframe>
                <p>
                    Marine Corps Air Station Yuma &#40;MCAS Yuma&#41; occupies approximately 3,000 acres within the City and County of Yuma, Arizona. The City of Yuma, the nearest municipality, is located about one mile northwest of the Station. Both the City and the Station
                    obtain their drinking water from the Colorado River through an irrigation canal.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The City does not use groundwater for drinking water purposes. The nearest domestic underground well is approximately 0.8 miles downgradient from the Marine Corps Air Station.
                </p>
                <p>
                    MCAS Yuma's mission is to provide services and materials support operations to the Marine Aircraft Wing and its subordinate units. In 1990, MCAS Yuma was placed on the Superfund National Priorities List after chlorinated solvents were detected in a groundwater
                    monitoring well on the Station.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Starting in the mid-1940s, waste fuels and solvents from the refueling and servicing of airplanes were reportedly disposed of directly onto the ground or into unlined pits at the Station site. Besides, combustible materials such as fuel oil and organic
                    solvents were deposited on the ground or burned during fire training exercises. Approximately 5,700 people live on-site. In the past, during maintenance work on the Colorado River irrigation canal which took place for two weeks each
                    year, drinking water was supplemented using an on-station well. However, this practice was stopped in August 1995.
